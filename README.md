# DSP-Signal-Viewer
Using python and streamlit framework, we designed a signal-viewer web application that you can view any type of medical signal on like ECG, EEG, EMG, .... etc. The signal-viewer can plot any signal dynamically in real time and you can view any part or frame of the signal statically. You can also plot 2 signals adjacent to each other and compare between them. Additionally, after uploading the 2 signals, you can link between them to plot them dynamically at the same time and compare between them at the same time frames.
